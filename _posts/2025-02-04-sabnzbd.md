[SabNZBd](https://sabnzbd.org/) is a multi-platform binary newsgroup downloader.

SABnzbd uses NZB files (similar to .torrent files, but for Usenet), instead of browsing Usenet directly. NZBs can be acquired from a variety of usenet indexing services.

SABnzbd's main interface is web-based, this means with a little bit of configuration you can easily check and add files from other PC's around the world or on other devices such as the iPhone. 

This service is routed via DelugeVPN 

> Since this uses media from my NAS i have simply decided to run this as a Docker Container on UnRAID on my NAS instead of having it as part of my kubernetes cluster to remove the need to access the NAS media remotely
