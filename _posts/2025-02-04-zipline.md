[Zipline](https://github.com/diced/zipline?tab=readme-ov-file) is a ShareX/file upload server that is easy to use, packed with features, and with an easy setup!

I use this as my ShareX Backend and also as a easy way to share clips, short url's etc.

> Since this stores data on my NAS i have simply decided to run this as a Docker Container on UnRAID on my NAS instead of having it as part of my kubernetes cluster to remove the need to access the NAS media remotely
