CUPS is a docker image including CUPS print server and printing drivers (installed from the Debian packages).

I use this to share my USB Ricoh SP211 Laser Printer over the network.

> Since this requires the printer to be physically connected, this runs as a Docker Container on UnRAID on my NAS
