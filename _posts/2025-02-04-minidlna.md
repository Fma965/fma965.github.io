MiniDLNA is server software with the aim of being fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP clients. The MiniDNLA daemon serves media files (music, pictures, and video) to clients on a network. Example clients include applications such as totem and xbmc, and devices such as portable media players, smartphones, and televisions. 

> Since this uses media from my NAS i have simply decided to run this as a Docker Container on UnRAID on my NAS instead of having it as part of my kubernetes cluster to remove the need to access the NAS media remotely, there are reasons that are not explained here as to why i am using an additional DLNA server instead of using Plex/Jellyfin
