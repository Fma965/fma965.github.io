Skip sponsor segments in YouTube videos playing on a YouTube TV device (see below for compatibility details).

This emulates a connected device such as a phone and controls the video playback to skip sections of Youtube videos, usually i use SmartTube but sometimes this is broken and this is my backup solution.

> I've not yet moved this to my K3S so it's currently running on my NAS via Docker standalone
