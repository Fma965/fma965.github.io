## [MinIO](https://min.io/)
MinIO is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It is software-defined and runs on any cloud or on-premises infrastructure. MinIO is dual-licensed under open source GNU AGPL v3 and a commercial enterprise license. 

> Since this uses data from my NAS i have simply decided to run this as a Docker Container on UnRAID on my NAS instead of having it as part of my kubernetes cluster to remove the need to access the NAS media remotely
