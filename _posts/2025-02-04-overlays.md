Overlays is a custom PHP based application in a Nginx container designed to easily see what games some friends and myself have and easily filter what games we can play based on player counts etc. it works along side the ws-broadcast docker container to allow easy WebSocket support for sending synced "random game choices"

It relies on a backend Directus service which is running in my K3S Cluster.
